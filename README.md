# TMS-Cortical-Exciteability
Code relevant to the NCSU BCI and Neuroergonomics / Translational Vision Research Lab collaboration studying the effects of auditory stimuli on cortical exciteability via TMS

## Looming sound details:

**Amp1, amp0.5, etc:** these files are stationary, 10s long clips used for validating volumes with an SPL monitor. To calibrate stimulus volumes for experiment, SPL meter should read ~75dB SPL (using dBA filter) on an SPL meter, measured in the experimental set up.


These files are to be used in the initial testing of different strengths of looming sounds
Strong Looming sound: runs from 57db to 75db (8 times volume increase)
Medium Looming sound: 63db to 75db (4 times volume increase)
Weak Looming sound: 69db to 75db (2 times volume increase)

*Note that at 400hz (the frequency of these stimuli) a ~6db increase represents a doubling in perceived loudness*
